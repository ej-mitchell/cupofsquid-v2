This post will be updated often. It will mark things I've been recommended, things I'm currently reading/listening to/etc. There might be some notes interspersed, and there will always be more to add.

### Podcasts

* [Scene on the Radio - _Seeing White_](https://www.sceneonradio.org/seeing-white/) (**completed**)
* [NPR - Throughline](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510333/throughline)

**Notes**: _Seeing White_ is mind-blowing. Ibram X. Kendi appears on some of the episodes - his books are on the top of my reading list.

### Events

### Articles

### Books (Non-fiction)

* _[White Rage](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/white-rage-9781632864123/) _ by Carol Anderson
* _[How to Be an Antiracist](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/how-to-be-an-antiracist/) _ by Ibram X. Kendi

* _[The End of Policing](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/the-end-of-policing/)_ by Alex S. Vitale
* [_Body and Soul: The Black Panther Party and the Fight against Medical Discrimination_](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/body-and-soul) __ by Alondra Nelson (**free book**)
* _[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/thinking-fast-and-slow/)_ by Daniel Kahneman (**currently reading**)

**Notes:** Kahneman's book is not officially on any list, but I've put it here because I started reading it before the protests began in an attempt to understand how we as humans think - and it's become crucial now more than ever to understand this. The book covers unconscious bias, jumping to conclusions, forming judgements, and other behind-the-scenes functions our brains perform.

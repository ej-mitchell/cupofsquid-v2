## Books

### Non-fiction

* [You Look Like a Thing and I Love You](https://bookpage.com/reviews/24510-janelle-shane-you-look-like-thing-nonfiction) by Janelle Shane - Janelle Shane is one of my favorite scientists and her book is a passionate and delightfully quirky exploration of artificial intelligence.
* [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking%2C_Fast_and_Slow) by  Daniel Kahneman - This is a must read. I loved this book. I still reference information from it in day-to-day conversations. Overall it‚Äôs great for understanding your biases at the unconscious level, which is originally why I started reading it. I ended up coming out of the experience with ideas of how to address negative or emotionally charged thinking that impacts decision making as well.
* [Algorithms of Oppression](http://algorithmsofoppression.com) by Safiya U. Noble, PhD - Eye-opening and, in a lot of ways, heartbreaking. It probably comes as no surprise that internet is tailored to the cis, white man. However, I don‚Äôt feel like that prepares you for reading this. Highly recommend, even if the writing style is not the best.

### Fiction

* [Gods of Jade and Shadow](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/gods-of-jade-and-shadow/) by Silvia Moreno-Garcia - This book was okay. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of lovey-dovey stuff, but it was doable to read even if you‚Äôre not into it. The symbolism is not subtle. Read this for a book club.
* [Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World](http://www.harukimurakami.com/book/hard-boiled-wonderland-and-the-end-of-the-world) by Haruki Murakami - Absolutely the fuck no. Murakami is a great writer, but the two things I‚Äôve read by him (the other being [19Q4](http://www.harukimurakami.com/book/1q84) ) have some moments when I want to tear the characters apart. This particular character was a mysogonist asshole and all the women were hollow.
* [House of Leaves](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/house-of-leaves/) by Mark Z. Danielewski - Wonderfully creepy and in an unusual format. Definitely not a before-bed book ‚Äì both in terms of nightmares and in terms of needing to have your wits about you while you read it.
* [Semiosis](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/semiosis/) by Sue Burke - I had so much hope for this book, but the author was just trying to be like Ursula K. Le Guin. And no one can be Le Guin. So overall, it was meh. I don‚Äôt plan on continuing the series.
* [Black Leopard, Red Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Leopard%2C_Red_Wolf) by Marlon James - Filled with beautiful imagery and epic fantasy. I loved the African mythology woven in.
* [Wanderers](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/wanderers/) by Chuck Wendig - It was over 1000 pages, but I finished it in a week. It grips you. There were some fundamental issues I had with parts of it, especially the ending, but overall, it was an enjoyable ride.
* [The Raven Tower](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/the-raven-tower/) by Anne Leckie - this was ~okay~ but I think I liked the Ancillary series better. I appreciated the homage to the Shakespearian format, though.
* [The Testaments](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/the-testaments-the-sequel-to-the-handmaids-tale/) by Margaret Atwood - More uplifting than I would‚Äôve expected, and that was much needed with this trash fire of a year. Atwood is probably one of my favorite writers, after Le Guin, so nothing she does can really disappoint me.
* [The Elementals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301053.The_Elementals) by Michael McDowell - Gah, so good! Creepy and crawly. Characters jump from the page. You feel like you are at Beldame yourself, experiencing everything. There are some dated and unfair treatments of women and people of color by the author, though, which irks me. The book is from the 80s, which doesn‚Äôt excuse it, but it is why I label it as ‚Äúdated‚Äù.
* [The Water Dancer](https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/the-water-dancer/) by Ta-Nehisi Coates - extremely well written and provoking. It is definitely "fantasy-lite" even though it is labeled as "fantasy". I would put it more under historical fiction.

## Bands

* [Will Wood (and the Tapeworms)](https://www.willwood.net/)
* [PHILDEL](https://www.phildel.com/)
* [Soccer Mommy](https://soccermommyband.com)
* [Cults](https://cults.bandcamp.com)

**Tantrum**

I want to throw a temper tantrumthe kind with fists ablaze, red face

the works

Maybe because I want to cryscreams knifing themselves outof my throat, ringing my earsgoing deaf on raw emotion

rare feelings go down bestwith a swig of wine and a spliff

these days only onions cause tearsdeaths a dull pattering in the chestthat broken feeling between

helplessness pushing onwardand kettle bells instead of feetpulling into yielding earth

**hail mary**

what is this I laidto rest on your lapit’s gently weeping

not my mother’s burdensnot your sickly soul

its tears are flowinggold and grey, itswings flung akimbo

perhaps a bird fromour time togetherbirthed from our wombscollectively forgetten

we didn’t wish to bleedfrom our mouths above

or below

but the Virgin Mary hasa way of choosingher children’s pain

we are told this canbe Overcome, but thesetears staining our skinwith metallic wetness

it tells a different story

**flesh**

why are we, why thesewhy so soft are we, theseprisons of flesh we areblades piercing until bloodwhy these wounds these scarswhy are we bound to thisthese bone bars are fullof writhing flesh inside outsidewhy are we, why these, whyare we the way we are

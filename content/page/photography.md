I'm available for portraits and event photography in Chittenden County, Vermont! I am especially keen on working with other queer folx in order to make a safe space for self-expression. I also hike and do a lot of nature photography on my own.

Contact me for other portrait examples, if needed! A lot of clients had asked me to keep them off my site for privacy purposes.

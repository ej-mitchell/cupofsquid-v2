Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my site. I consider it a parking spot for unedited thoughts
as I navigate with community through a rapidly changing world. I am an artist,
writer, uncle to a dog and a human child, as well as an avid naturalist.

[Reach out to me](mailto:hello@cupofsquid.com) if you want to collaborate on
anything! Current projects are listed below.

### Now

* Learning to live off-grid
* Moving across state lines to find land for the above venture
* Just finished my first vending opportunity as an artist
* Slowly transitioning to living as a writer full time

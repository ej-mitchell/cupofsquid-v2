Hello! üëã  My name is Eiven. I also go by "EJ". I'm nonbinary and use they/he pronouns.

{{< figure src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/06061E49-191B-4988-A53D-28671504FD23.jpeg" >}}

I work as a freelancer, doing pretty much whatever is thrown at me, including writing, art, and software development.

When I am not doing this, I am exploring non-hierarchical societies and understanding how to make them a reality. I currently live in a housing co-op with five of my close friends, experimenting with new ways of living outside of the capitalist system.

For fun, I am an active 4-season hiker. I spend a lot of time in my home state of VT and also in the White Mountains of NH, where I've been working on my 48 4K-footers (31 down!!).

In addition to hiking, I've been focusing a lot of creative energy on food, art, and alternative communities. My pages on this site are a reflection of that.

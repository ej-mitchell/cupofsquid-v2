Lately, as of 2022, I've been commissioned for a wide variety of things, including designs for musicians and avatars for social media profiles.

I do traditional ink and watercolor drawings, acrylic on canvas, just pen drawings, and have been also using Procreate. The latter seems to be the most popular due to ease of distribution, and lack of shipping costs (esp. in the case of canvasses). I'm also open to trying other media; learning anything with my hands is really the only skill I have, so I try to take advantage of it.

Prices are done on a sliding scale. I believe art should be affordable and enjoyed by all. That being said, if you can afford it, please offer to pay on the higher end of the scale so those who cannot can still have something they enjoy. This also enables me to purchase materials, which can be expensive.

If you want to order some ready-made merchandise, I do have some art up on [RedBubble](http://eejum.redbubble.com/).

If your interest is piqued and you have an idea, you can [commission me](mailto:art@cupofsquid.com). More up-to-date art is on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gay.little.gremlin/).

Here is some of my older work, pre-digital-art binge:
